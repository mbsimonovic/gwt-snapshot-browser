 * An adapter to make any {@link Browser} thread-safe by serializing all requests to

 * Thread-safe. No client-side locking required. To guarantee thread-safety, the given
 * browser instance should be exclusively owned by this class.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * The reason for using this class is memory leak when HtmlUnit's WebClient is used
 * via ThreadLocal in a thread-pool where threads start and stop.
